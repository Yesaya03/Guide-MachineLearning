## Feature Engineering

In feature engineering, we can perform a transformation for machine learning modelling needs. Machine learning only accepts numeric data. All data types are converted into numeric form to enter machine learning modelling. The process of converting data types into numeric formats is called feature engineering.

There are several ways to convert type data non-numeric into type data numeric:

1. Converts categorical data to numeric data

This way, it is often referred to as One Hot Encoding. We can use syntax `get_dummies()` with parameters: data, prefix and drop_first
